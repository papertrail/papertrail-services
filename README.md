Service hooks for [Papertrail][].

Search Alert Service Lifecycle
------------------------------

1. A background job looking for new messages matching a saved search on
   [Papertrail][]
2. If any Search Alerts have been configured it triggers a request to
   `https://<services-server>/<service_name>/logs` with the post data:
   - `params[:settings]`: the options the user specified in the Search Alert configuration
   - `params[:payload]`: the event data for the matched log messages
3. A [sinatra][] app [lib/papertrail_services/app.rb][] decodes the request
   and dispatches it to a registered service if it exists


Writing a Service
-----------------

All services are found in the [services/][] directory. They must have a method
named `receive_logs` that is called when an alert is matched.

The settings are available as a `Hash` in the instance method `settings` and
the event payload is available as a `Hash` in the instance method `payload`.

Helper methods for dealing with basic formatting are available in
[lib/papertrail_services/helpers/logs_helpers.rb][] and also contains a sample
payload.

Tests should accompany all services and are located in the [services/][]
directory.


Sample Service
--------------

Here's a simple service that just counts the number of messages that were
received and posts them to a service.

```ruby
class Service::Sample < Service
  def receive_logs
    count = payload[:events].length

    http_post 'https://sample-service.com/post.json' do |req|
      req.body = {
        settings[:name] => count
      }
    end
  end
end
```

Sample Payload
--------------

This is a sample `payload` that is also available in [lib/papertrail_services/helpers/logs_helpers.rb][].

```ruby
{
  "min_id"=>"31171139124469760", "max_id"=>"31181206313902080", "reached_record_limit" => true, "frequency"=>"1 minute",
